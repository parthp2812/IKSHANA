## Assistant for the blind.

####  Made a collection of CNN architectures and trained the model. Then evaluated the performance of all the models and chose the one with the best accuracy. Got a training accuracy of about 97%. Got roughly same accuracy for all the trained model but realized that the model in which implemented regularization performed better on the test set
